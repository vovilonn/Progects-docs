# Get started

First of all, we need to clone our app from the [**github**](https://github.com/kolbak/NFT).

`>git clone https://github.com/kolbak/NFT.git`

And change directory to NFT folder

`>cd NFT`

## Run the app

Before the starting app, we need to build it

To build in development mode - `npm run develop`

To build in production mode - `npm run build`

And run the app - `npm run serve`

```
You can now view nft in the browser.

http://localhost:9000/
```
